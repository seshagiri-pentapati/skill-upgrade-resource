System Design:-
► Read-Heavy Systems 
These focus on scale, latency, and efficient data fetching. 
1. Design a URL Shortener (Bitly) 
 → Talk about key generation, collisions, and DB storage. 
 → Add caching and DB sharding if traffic is high.

2. Design an Image Hosting Service 
 → Talk about object storage (S3, GCS) + CDN usage. 
 → Consider image deduplication and resizing strategies.

3. Design a Social Media Platform (Twitter/Facebook) 
 → Talk about posts, timelines, relationships (follows, friends). 
 → Focus on denormalized storage and sharding.

4. Design a NewsFeed System (Hard) 
 → Push vs Pull models, Fanout on Write vs Read. 
 → Caching, pagination, and ranking algorithms.

► Write-Heavy Systems 
Here, durability, throughput, and ingestion speed are critical.

5. Design a Rate Limiter 
 → Token bucket or leaky bucket algorithms. 
 → Redis-backed counters + TTL logic.

6. Design a Log Collection and Analysis System 
 → Use Kafka for ingestion, and something like ELK for processing. 
 → Talk about partitioning, buffering, and real-time querying.

7. Design a Voting System 
 → Idempotency, fraud prevention, and result aggregation. 
 → Real-time vs eventual vote count updates.

8. Design a Trending Topics System 
 → Use count-min sketch or approximate counting. 
 → Talk about sliding window aggregation + ranking.

► Strong Consistency Systems 
Transactional integrity and failure handling become the focus.

9. Design an Online Ticket Booking System 
 → Handle race conditions with locking or optimistic concurrency. 
 → Talk about seat reservation + payment flow.

10. Design an E-Commerce Website (Amazon) 
 → Cover product catalog, cart service, order processing. 
 → Include DB consistency, checkout idempotency.

11. Design an Online Messaging App (WhatsApp/Slack) 
 → Talk about message queues, delivery receipts, retries. 
 → Offline storage, notification delivery, scaling chat infra.

12. Design a Task Management Tool 
 → CRUD APIs, user auth, task assignment. 
 → Background jobs, status updates, and audit trails.

► Scheduler Services 
Timing, reliability, and eventual execution are tested here.

13. Design a Web Crawler 
 → BFS vs DFS for crawling, politeness rules. 
 → Distributed queues, duplicate URL filters.

14. Design a Task Scheduler 
 → Job queues, retry logic, cron-based triggers. 
 → Priority queues and task deduplication.

15. Design a Real-Time Notification System 
 → Push vs Polling, webhooks, and device token mgmt. 
 → Scale delivery across millions of users
