 Angular Interview Topics:-
 
1. Component communication – real-time tasks around @Input, @Output, and EventEmitter.
2. State management – they don’t always expect NgRx, but they’ll ask how you’d manage shared data in a scalable way.
3. Performance optimization – practical things like OnPush change detection, trackBy in ngFor, lazy loading, preloading strategies.
4. Forms – both reactive and template-driven, with a hands-on exercise like building a dynamic form with validations.
5. RxJS – very common. Interviewers give scenarios like “multiple API calls in sequence” or “cancel previous API call on new input.”
6. Routing – guards, resolvers, role-based routing – they usually give a real-world scenario.
7. Error handling & interceptors – asked almost everywhere, since it connects Angular with APIs.
8. Unit testing – not always, but bigger product companies ask you to write simple Jasmine/Karma tests.
9. Hands-on activities – most realistic ones I faced:
- Implementing a search with debounce using RxJS
- Building a simple CRUD screen (list, add, edit, delete) with a mock API
- Optimizing a component with heavy loops
- Writing an interceptor for JWT token handling
